## Why am I here?

*jour2106*  is **the only** course I am taking in the last semester in this University. Already fulfilled all the graduation requirements, I still find myself not well-equipped for media industry. Therefore, I want to expose myself in a completely new field.

### What topic am I interested in

**ANY topics about Society Issues** (which is a lot...)

#### To know me better...

*Most of my achievements can be found in my [personal webiste](https://14220741.wixsite.com/mysite), which is simply made by Wix. You can also find a few photos taken by me there, hope you'll like it‚ù§Ô∏è*
